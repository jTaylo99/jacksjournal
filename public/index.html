      <h2> Welcome to Jack's Journal</h2>

      <p>
        Hello, I am Jack. I am a dev that wishes to one day get into game development, and I have a great interest in games and film.

        This is meant to be some sort of place for me to write my thoughts on different types of media as well as experiment with different web dev ideas. Right now this is extremely basic (I'm starting off with just putting my posts in the
        main HMTL page very gross), but I hope to expand this over time and integrate other tools. For now however, I just wanted to get something basic going so I can get to writing quickly. I'm not necessarily the greatest writer, but
        hopefully over time that can change.

        Once I start making more progress in learning Unreal Engine, I can hopefully showcase some of the things I learn there too! I'm still early in the stages of learning it, but I see this as something that will be a continuous effort
        so I am hopeful.
      </p>

      <h2>Rift of the Necrodancer</h2>
      <p>
        This is a game I think rhythm game fanatics will love. I played through the game on normal and felt that even that gave a good challenge. I wish that it leaned more into the Rhythm Heaven inspired levels, but that mostly comes from
        there being a lack of Rhythm Heaven type games (please Nintendo release a new one soon). The actual gameplay itself is solid, and has set a fantastic foundation for them to release more content as time goes on. Not long after release
        the devs even released some Super Meat Boy tracks - and based off Crypt of the Necrodancer's updates I think we will see a lot here.
        <br><br>
        The game also has Steam Workshop support, and I feel this will hep a great amount for keeping players engaged. I played around with some tracks and people are already getting incredibly creative with it. I can see this being a game
        I come back to every few weeks and check out what's new both in official content and workshop content. The content that already exists will keep a lot of people going however, with the difficulty getting to a point that hardcore
        rhythm gamers will love. I don't think I could ever get good enough to tackle that difficulty, but hard is perfect for me.
        <br><br>
        Definitely check this out if you haven't already and want to get your hands on a new rhythm game. The art is great, the tracks are a good listen, and the gameplay will keep you hooked. Don't expect too much from the mini-games, they're good
        fun but won't last you long. These devs are worth supporting and I believe this game has a great future ahead of it.
